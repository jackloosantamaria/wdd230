            <p> Visual Hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show 
                their order of importance. The visual characteristics help the 
                users understand information easily. It influences users' perceptions 
                and guide them to desired actions. Amazon is a good example of Visual 
                Hierarchy as its homepage uses a clear Visual Hierarchy to guide users 
                through varios sections.</p>

            <section class="background"><h3>Hick's Law</h3></section>
            <h4>Dell</h4>
            <div><a href="https://www.dell.com" target="_blank">Dell.com</a></div>
            <img src="images/dell2.webp" alt="Dell Website on Mobile device">
            <p> Hick's Law is a principle that says that the more choices you present your user with,
                the longer it will take them to reach a decision. This principle make our products
                more intuitive to navigate and reduce the time to value. By prioritzing the most 
                important features we avoid overwhelming the user and reduce their reaction time.
                Dell is a good example of Hick's Law as they have priotize their most important 
                products and service to reduce their user's reaction time.

            <h4>Spotify</h4>
            <section class="background3"><h3>Fitt's Law</h3></section>
            <div><a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify.com</a></div>
            <img src="images/spotify2.webp" alt="Spotify Website on Mobile device">
            <p> Fitt's Law is a principle that suggests that the most important and frequently used elements
                should be large and placed in easily accessible positions. This reduces effort and interaction
                time, thus improving usability and efficiency. Spotify is a good example of this principle since 
                its most important elements are large in size, which makes it easier to select music while reducing
                effort and discomfort.
